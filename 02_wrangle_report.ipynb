As a result, we were left with missing values in the columns concerned so we dropped the missing data and columns.\n","\n","Secondly, variable/features datatype is key in every data analysis. We had to change wrong datatypes to their approach datatypes to ease analysis.\n","\n","Thirdly, we had instances of wrong entry in the data. For this, there were two instances, we had a dogtionary entry of '_None_' and also dogs with name '_a_'. We changed both instances to the standard numpy _np.nan_.\n","\n","Furthermore, we combined the dogtionary columns to become one which makes it easier to group what kind of dog it is according to the dictionary provided.\n","\n","Finally, we combined the three datasets using the tweet id which is a unique value for each particular tweet."],"metadata":{"id":"kFIYTMJeFaBY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Conclusion\n","\n","In this report, we have been able to describe briedfly the data wrangling efforts used to achieve the project and the steps taken to execute them."],"metadata":{"id":"jesSk0J7H4Cl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Challenges/Limitation\n","\n","There were challenges with using the Twitter Developer account and requesting for elevated access."],"metadata":{"id":"DFiIFjSuHo1c"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# References"],"metadata":{"id":"-xRMHfwlynF1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- [What Is Data Wrangling?
